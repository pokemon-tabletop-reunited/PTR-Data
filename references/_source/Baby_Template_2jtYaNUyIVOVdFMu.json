If so, simply subtract 2, 3, or even 4 from each of the Pokémon’s Base Stats, lower each of their Skills one Rank, and lower their Capabilities by 2. Weight and height are lowered accordingly, by up to 50%. Pokémon tend to grow quickly; every 5 levels, they gain +1 to each of their Base Stats, and they grow in size a little. When they have finally regained all of their Base Stats, remove the penalties to skills and capabilities. This template isn’t necessary for Pokémon that are already quite weak; a baby Sentret probably doesn’t need this applied, for example, and don’t even consider it on a Weedle. If your Trainers somehow gain a baby Pinsir or Tauros early on, you may wish to dampen those Stats however. You can also use this Template to make Legendary Pokémon usable by PCs! You could even make it permanent or partly permanent, especially on Pokémon with a Base Stat Total of over 60 or so.",
