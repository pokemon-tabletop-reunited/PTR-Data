You may not  use this to avoid melee attacks by switching between  making their distance greater or less - a value is chosen  when an action is announced and cannot be changed  afterwards. Scene Effect: You may activate this Pact Gift once per  Scene when hit by a single target attack. The attack  instead hits a target of your choice in an adjacent square  to you.",
