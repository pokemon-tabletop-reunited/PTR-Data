Make a Focus check as if you were using Telepath.  On a success, you instill a thought or action into the  Target’s mind as if it were one of their own. They may  not immediately act on it, and will question it if it is  too alien from how they would normally act, but the  thought will persist as long as they are unaware of its  origin.",
