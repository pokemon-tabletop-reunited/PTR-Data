Secondly, choose two Combat Stage gains for the effect. This may either be +2 Combat Stages to a single Stat, like Swords Dance, or +1 Combat Stage to two different Stats, like Dragon Dance. Once chosen, this cannot be changed. Dragon Dance, Quiver Dance, and Swords Dance count as Dance Moves for the purposes of Dancer Features as well. A Dance Move’s Contest Type must be chosen from a Contest Type associated with a Stat that the Dance Move affects. Cool is associated with Attack, Tough is associated with Defense, Beauty is associated with Special Attack, Smart is associated with Special Defense, and Cute is associated with Speed.
