If they do, all participants make opposed Combat or Athletics Checks. Whoever wins then may choose to either continue the Grapple and gain Dominance, or to end the Grapple.\n\nIf a target has the Phasing or Teleporter Capability, they may also use those to escape from a Grapple on their turn with no check required.\n\nIf a target begins their turn as part of a Grapple and has Dominance, they may take one of the following actions as a Full Action.\n» End the Grapple.\n» Secure: They gain a +3 Bonus to the next opposed check they make in the Grapple.\n» Attack: They may automatically hit with an Unarmed Struggle Attack.\n» Move: They Shift, dragging the other person in the grapple with them.
