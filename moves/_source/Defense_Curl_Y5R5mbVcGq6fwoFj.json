However, while Curled Up, the user is Slowed and their Accuracy is lowered by 4. The user may stop being Curled Up as a Swift Action, or if they are Recalled or Take a Breather. If the user has Rollout or Ice Ball in their Move List, they do not become Slowed while Curled Up, and the user gains a +10 bonus to the damage rolls of those Moves and does not suffer Accuracy Penalties from being Curled Up when using those moves.",
