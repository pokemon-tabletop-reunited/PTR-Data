The user then changes to Schooling Forme, centered on its current location, and gains Temporary Hit Points equal to half of its own maximum Hit Points. The user cannot gain Temporary Hit Points from other sources while in Schooling Forme.\\nWhen the user is below half Maximum HP and has no Temporary Hit Points left, they change back into Solo Forme. If the user would not be able to fit in the space around it at the end of this Ability, this Ability may not be used. The user has two sets of base stats; Solo and Schooling.\\nThe HP of both forms must be the same. Innate.",
