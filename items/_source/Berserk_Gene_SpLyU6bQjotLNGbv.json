When used on a Pokemon as a consumable item, it raises its Attack and Speed by three Combat Stages each, but Enrages and Confuses it.\n\nThis item is also used to create Shadow Pok√©mon, and is consumed in the process of creating one. Acquisition of this item can vary, but the most common method is to extract this gene from a Shadow Pokemon. Berserk Genes are considered an illegal item and can be found on the black market for $10,000, or far more.",
