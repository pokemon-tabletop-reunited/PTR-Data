Toxic Spikes cause Terrain to become Slow Terrain, and a grounded foe that runs into the hazard becomes Poisoned and Slowed until the end of their next turn. If there are 2 layers of Toxic Spikes on the same space, it Badly Poisons the foes instead. Poison-Type Pokemon may move over Toxic Spikes harmlessly, destroying the Hazards as they do so.",
