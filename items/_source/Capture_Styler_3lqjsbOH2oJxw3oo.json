    "effect": "A Capture Styler is a Main-Hand specialized piece of equipment used by some certified Pokémon Rangers in a region. It emits a string of energy that is used in a similar fashion to a lasso but is too weak to physically restrain a target. Instead, the energy has a calming effect on Pokémon. Trainers using a Capture Styler may use Survival in place of Charm when raising the Disposition of Pokémon. \n\nAcquiring a Capture Styler is easy for those who become certified Pokémon Rangers; most qualified Rangers receive one as part of the job. They are not for sale to the general public, and it’s easy to assume that someone who has a Capture Styler is a Ranger.",
