When a Flute is crafted, it is tied to a particular Status Condition. Once per day, the Flute may be played as a Standard Action. All Pok√©mon and Trainers within 20 meters of the Flute are cured of that Status. These rare artifacts cannot be found in most ordinary stores but may cost upwards of $4000 from an appropriate occult vendor.",
