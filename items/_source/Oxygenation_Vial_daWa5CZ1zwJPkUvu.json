    "effect": "These vials contain a solution of oxygen-encasing lipids that are injected directly into the bloodstream. One injection is enough to allow the user to go without breathing for up to thirty minutes. Subsequent injections extend the effect, but each one after the first in a 24 hour period causes the user to take one injury as their body suffers complications from the imbalance caused by the solution. These are often carried as a last resort device for astronauts and deep sea divers, as well as used by EMTs to stabilize patients.",
