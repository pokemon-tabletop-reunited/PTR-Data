    "effect": "A long net, usually on the end of a long stick, these pieces of two-handed Equipment are usually used for bug catching or fishing. As an AC6 Status Attack, you may attempt to net a Small Pokémon using this item. If you hit, you manage to scoop up the Pokémon, trapping them. You may move with the Pokémon, dragging them with you. Pokémon may still attack from the Hand Net using long-range attacks, or try to attack the net itself, potentially breaking it and freeing themselves. Capture Rolls against Pokémon in a net receive a -20 bonus.\n\nHand Nets with 50 Hit Points cost $100; 100 Hit Points cost $600; and 200 Hit Points cost $1500. Nets aren’t broken until all of their Hit Points are depleted.",
