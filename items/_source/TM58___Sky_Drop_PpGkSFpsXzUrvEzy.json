The target forfeits their next turn and cannot Shift or take actions until Sky Drop is resolved. Resolution Effect: Shift while in the air and lower both the user and the target heights back to the ground. Then apply Sky Drop's damage. If the target has a Sky or Levitate Speed, Sky Drop fails to deal damage. If the user is Fainted after the Set-Up but before the Resolution, the target falls to the ground and takes damage as if Sky Drop had a Damage Base of 3 (1d6+5/8) unless they have a Sky or Levitate Speed, in which case they take no damage.",
