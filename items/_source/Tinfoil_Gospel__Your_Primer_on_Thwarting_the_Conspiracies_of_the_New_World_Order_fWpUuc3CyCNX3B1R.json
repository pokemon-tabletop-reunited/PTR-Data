Pok√©mon and Trainers with the Aura Reader Capability cannot discern the tint of your Aura and must succeed on an opposed Intuition or Focus Check vs your Occult Education or Focus in order to read the hue of your Aura. Upon failure, they may not attempt to read your Aura again for the remainder of the Scene.",
