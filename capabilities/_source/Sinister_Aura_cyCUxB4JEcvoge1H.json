A shadowy aura perpetually surrounds the user, visible by those with the Aura Reader capability or with an item that allows its the user to see Auras.\n\nThe aura is more pronounced during Hyper Mode, emitting an oppressive pressure, even affecting those that can't see Auras. While in Hyper Mode the user receives a +2 Bonus to Intimidate Skill checks.\n\nApex or XD-Series Shadow Pokémon often have differently-manifested Auras, usually being more voluminous and intense, or with different patterns and flows. These can grant other miscellaneous effects to a Shadow Pokémon and its aura, at the GM’s discretion.",
