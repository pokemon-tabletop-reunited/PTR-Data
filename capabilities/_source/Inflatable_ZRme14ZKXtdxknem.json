    "effect": "A Pokémon with the capability Inflatable can expand its size up to 125% of its normal size as a Standard Action. While Inflated, a Pokémon does not change its weight. When Inflated, Pokémon gain a -1 Penalty to Evasion, but become Blocking Terrain; you may not target through an Inflated Pokémon. Returning to normal size is a Shift Action. If a Pokémon learns the Move Growth or Stockpile and does not have the Inflatable Capability, they gain Inflatable. A Pokémon under the effects of Minimize may not become Inflated, and an Inflated Pokémon may not use the Move Minimize.",
