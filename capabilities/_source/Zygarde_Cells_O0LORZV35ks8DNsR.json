These may be disassembled into the number of Cells that they were created from as an Extended Action. 100 Cells may form either a 10% or 50% Zygarde with the Power Construct Ability instead of Aura Break. The resulting Zygarde may not be disassembled, but may be changed between 10% and 50% Formes as an Extended Action using the Cube. The GM determines the Nature and Level of any Zygarde formed. As an Extended Action, a Cube may Tutor Zygarde available Cube moves for 1 TP each.",
