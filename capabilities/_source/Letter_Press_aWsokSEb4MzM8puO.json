    "effect": "Unown with the Letter Press capability may be combined with other Unown, creating a Prime Unown, or adding to an existing Prime Unown. The first four times you add an Unown to a Prime Unown, including the creation of the Prime Unown, add 5 points to any one of the Prime Unown’s Base stats. Combined Unown may retain different instances of Hidden Power from each individual Unown, up the normal Move List limit. When combining Unown with the Letter Press capability, for each instance of Hidden Power, choose whether it will operate on Attack stat or Special Attack stat. This choice is permanent. Unowns combined with Letter Press can be kept in a single Poké Ball, essentially becoming a single Pokémon. Once combined with Letter Press, Unowns cannot be separated. Prime Unown lose the Underdog Capability.",
