Necrozma’s Movement and Jumping capabilities become the bonded Pokémon’s, as does Power if the bond’s is higher. Necrozma’s Athletics, Acrobatics, Combat, Stealth, and Perception become\\nthe bonded Pokémon’s, though they are increased by one rank, to a maximum of 6d6. Necrozma takes the bond’s Primary Type (or Secondary Type if its Primary Type is Psychic) as its Secondary Type.\\nWhile bonded, the GM will designate one move as the bonded species’ Level-Up Movelist as its ‘signature move’. Necrozma may add this move to its learned movelist as long as it is bonded, following normal movelist restrictions, as long as it is of a level to learn it normally.\\nFor Solgaleo, this move is always Sunsteel Strike; for Lunala, this move is always Moongeist Beam. These Pokémon have specific forms used while bonded.",
