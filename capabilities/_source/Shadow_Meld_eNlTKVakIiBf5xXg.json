While doing so, Gengar receives a +4 bonus to Stealth rolls, gains +1 to its evasion, and can travel along a surface as if completely flat. Gengar may also “ride” along on a living creature’s shadow, moving along with it as the creature moves. Gengar may not use Standard Actions while melded into shadow. Reforming is a Shift Action.",
