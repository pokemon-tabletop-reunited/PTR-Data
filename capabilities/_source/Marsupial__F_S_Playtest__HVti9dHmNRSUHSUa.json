    "effect": "Kangaskhan is always born with the Baby Template (see Optional Rules), subtracting 5 from each of its Base Stats. While Kangaskhan have the Baby Template, they live in their mother’s pouch and will not willingly leave it for long; their bond is so strong, that both Pokémon are able to be captured in a single Pokeball during this time. While Kangaskhan has the Baby Template, it cannot be Commanded to fight or take any action. Mother Kangaskhan with a Baby in their pouch are exceptional at protecting their babies; attacks cannot target Kangaskhan inside their mother’s pouch while she is conscious. Trainers raising a Kangaskhan may choose to have their Mother Kangaskhan gain 20% less experience from any sources and give that Experience to the baby instead. Once a Baby Kangaskhan reaches level 25 and loses the Baby Template, it exits its mother’s pouch permanently. If the Mother has Friendship of 2 or more, the Baby will allow the trainer to capture it effortlessly.",
