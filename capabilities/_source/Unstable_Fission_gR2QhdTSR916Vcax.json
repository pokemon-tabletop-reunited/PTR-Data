    "effect": "Urayne requires radiation to feed off of, its strength determined by how much it is able to consume.\n\nUsing a Uranium Core, as an Extended Action once per day, Urayne may be fed either a Small Amount or Large Amount of radiation (it is up to the GM whether any individual core is able to provide Large Amounts of radiation).\n\nBeing fed a Small Amount transforms Urayne into its Beta Forme, while being fed a Large Amount transforms Urayne into its Gamma Fome. All forms must have the same HP base stat as in its Alpha Forme, even if that forces BSR to be broken.\n\nAfter a Scene in which it has been outside of its Pok√©ball, if in Beta Forme, it reverts to Alpha Forme. If in Gamma Forme, it instead reverts to Beta Forme. Upon reverting to a different Forme, Urayne takes an injury.",
