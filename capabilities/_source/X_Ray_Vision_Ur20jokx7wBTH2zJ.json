Objects seen through X-Ray vision are seen as white shapes and outlines without much detailed definition. The effectiveness of X-Ray Vision depends on the object’s material. Anything thin from paper to light wood to most residential drywall allows clear X-Ray Vision through it, while lead and tungsten would block X-Ray Vision entirely.",
