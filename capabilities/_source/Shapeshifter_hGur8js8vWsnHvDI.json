When using this Capability, the user cannot increase or decrease its total mass by more than 50%, and they cannot replicate complex machines such as computers or phones. They may take on the appearance of these devices, but they will appear simplified in comparison. They can, however, transform into other moving forms such as acting as someone’s prosthetic limb, a living lever or pulley system, or a Pokémon comparable in size. Note in this last case that the Shapeshifter doesn’t gain any qualities of that Pokémon without actually using the Move Transform! Anyone closely examining a Shapeshifter Pokémon may determine its true nature with a Perception Check opposed by the Pokémon’s Stealth. If a Pokémon learns the Move Transform and does not have the Shapeshifter Capability, they gain Shapeshifter.",
