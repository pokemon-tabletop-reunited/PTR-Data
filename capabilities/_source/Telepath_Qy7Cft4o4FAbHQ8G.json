    "effect": "A Telepathic Pokémon can read the surface thoughts of people and other Pokémon X meters away where X is Focus Rank doubled. Pokémon with Telepathy can project their thoughts to the minds of other Trainers or Pokémon with Telepathy. Trainers with Telepathy can project their thoughts to the minds of any Trainer or Pokémon. Telepathy can be used to read only one target at a time but can project to on a number of separate targets at once equal to half the user’s Focus Rank. Telepathy may be used to read minds with or without making the target aware of the attempt. Unwilling targets and targets that are unaware automatically resist the Telepathy attempt; the user and target roll opposed Focus Checks to determine if the Telepathy attempt is successful. A failure imposes a cumulative -3 penalty to future checks to use Telepathy on that target for the next 24 hours. Using Telepathy on an Unwilling target leaves discoverable psychic residue.",
