After that, the Prison Bottle cannot be activated again for three days. If the Prison Bottle is destroyed, this Pokémon becomes permanently Unbound until a new Prison Bottle is created and used to seal the dark power controlling this Pokémon.\\n While Unbound, this Pokémon is always Enraged and cannot be cured of this condition.\\n This Pokémon has a different set of Moves for each Forme. However, some of this Pokémon’s Moves in one Forme are linked to other moves in its other Forme, as listed in its statblock. If one of this Pokémon’s Formes learns one of the linked moves, the other Forme automatically learns the associated Move, replacing another Move if necessary. If one of the linked Moves is forgotten, the associated Move on the other Forme is also forgotten.",
