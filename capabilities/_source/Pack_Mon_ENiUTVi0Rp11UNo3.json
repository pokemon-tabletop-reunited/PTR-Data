Wild Pokémon that are of this Pokémon’s unevolved form or at least 10 levels lower than the user will instantly obey the user’s commands; showing a Pokémon with Pack Mon to a group of Wilds will put them at a Fearful disposition. However, two Pack Mons of the same species and within 10 Levels of each other will fight for dominance of the group. If a Wild Pack Leader is ten levels higher than your Pokémon, it will expect your Pokémon to obey it, and may attack if it does not.",
