If the Pokémon has smelt whom they want to track in the past day, or one of their personal belongings, they can pursue that prey with a Perception check of 8 or better. To pick-up a random scent from nothing, a Perception check of 14 or better will allow the Pokémon to follow that scent. To pick-up a specific scent from nothing, a Perception check of 20 will allow the Pokémon to follow that scent. A Pokémon may only make these checks once per hour. If a Pokémon learns the Move Odor Sleuth and does not have the Tracker Capability, they gain Tracker.",
