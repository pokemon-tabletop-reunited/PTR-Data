The magnitude of the impending disaster and its proximity to the Pokémon both affect how often they get this sense before a disaster and how long in advance the warning is. Closer and bigger disasters tend to have a greater effect and may alert the Pokémon to the specific area where a disaster will occur days in advance, while lesser disasters may simply give the Pokémon an odd sense of unease several hours before they hit.",
