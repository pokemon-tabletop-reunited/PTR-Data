The lighter the soul is then the more likely they are to do good and the more darkness that is in the soul means the more likely someone is to do something bad. When a soul is smaller that means the person is more injured, and the opposite is true the larger it is. If the soul has cracks on it then that means the person has suffered a traumatic event and they will only heal once those events have been overcome. Upon first view of a soul it normally starts foggy, but after a minute it takes shape and the user may determine the former details.",
