You are immune to Moves with the Illusion keyword, Double Team cannot be activated against you, and you bypass Substitutes. As a Standard Action, you can create a Burst 4, dispelling all Illusion effects within.\nDisguises and Illusions: Disguises in general refer to things with physical components; a mundane disguise would be the kind with props and fake moustaches and the like. An example of a magical disguise would be a Dittoâ€™s transformation. Illusions are magical effects, such as the Move Double Team, Substitute, or the Illusion Ability.",
