You or your Pokémon may activate Natural Fighter as a Standard Action to use the Move below corresponding to the current terrain. You and your Pokémon must still follow all Frequency limitations for the Move.\n- Grassland: Grass Whistle or Cotton Spore\n- Forest: Aromatherapy or Grass Knot\n- Wetlands: Mud Slap or Mud Sport\n- Ocean: Aqua Ring or Water Sport\n- Tundra: Haze or Icy Wind\n- Mountain: Smack Down or Stealth Rock\n- Cave: Astonish or Covet\n- Urban: Spikes or Pay Day\n- Desert: Sand Attack or Sand Tomb\n> Note: GMs! Don’t be super duper strict about the terrains here. Obviously a beach is analogous enough to a desert to use Sand Attack, and a lake can count as ocean terrain. In urban terrain, there’ll probably at least be trash around to Fling with the standard 6 DB option. On the other hand, most standard arenas for League matches won’t qualify for any of the terrains. However, some arenas may be specifically designed to emulate a terrain type, such as a rocky stadium or a set of floating platforms in a pool.\n{.is-info}",
