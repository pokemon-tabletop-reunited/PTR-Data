    "effect": "Trigger: Your Pokémon is the target of a foe’s damaging melee attack\nEffect: The triggering attack automatically hits as if it was a Critical Hit. Before damage resolves, your Pokémon may use a 1-Target damaging attack on the foe making the triggering attack as an Interrupt, Frequency allowing, and also automatically hits as a Critical Hit. Damage for both attacks then resolve at the same time.\nIf your Target has Spirit, this attack does 5 more damage for each Spirit it has. If the Target has Weary, the user gains 5 Temporary Hit Points for each level of Weary before resolving damage.\nNote: This effect bypasses immunity to Critical Hits on your own Pokémon, but not on the target. Though both attacks hit automatically and are Critical Hits, you may still roll to activate effects.",
