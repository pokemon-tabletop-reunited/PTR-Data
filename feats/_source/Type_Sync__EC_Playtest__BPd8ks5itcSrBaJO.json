A Pok√©mon may be targeted by the same instance of Type Sync only once.\n\nNote: You may take Type Sync multiple times. Each time, you must choose a different Elemental Connection.\n\n*Type-Linked Classes include Type Ace and all Elementalist Classes, all of which are linked to their respective Types. Additionally, Aura Guardian is linked to Fighting; and Telekinetic, Telepath, and Warper are linked to Psychic. Obviously, your Type Linked Class must match your Elemental Connection to apply for Type Sync!\n\n**Note, Type Sync cannot shift Pokemon to the Shadow Type.",
