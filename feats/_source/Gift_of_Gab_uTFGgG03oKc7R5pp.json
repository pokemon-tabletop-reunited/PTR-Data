Others cannot understand this language; to them, it sounds like a meaningless series of sounds unless they have other ways of understanding you or your Pokémon.\n\nBonus: You gain a +1d6 to Guile, Charm, and Intimidate checks against Pokémon who have a member of their evolutionary family in your Pokedex. If you have the Mystic senses trait, you gain a 1d6 bonus to using it replace a Guile, Charm, or Intimidate check against those Pokémon.\n\nNote: If your game doesn't use or heavily feature Pokédex’s, any Pokémon that the trainer has seen before qualifies",
