As long as the target is afflicted, they are one step less Resistant to Grass-Type attacks, to a maximum of neutral damage, and they cannot recover Hit Points or gain Temporary Hit Points. Whenever they would do so, you gain those Hit Points or Temporary Hit Points instead. Overgrowth is removed when the target Takes a Breather or is hit by a damaging Fire, Ice, Poison, Flying, or Bug-Type attack. Overgrowth may only affect a target once per Scene.",
