All legal targets passing through these squares must make an Acrobatics check with a DC equal to 4 + twice your Survival Rank. On failure, the target is Tripped. Pok√©mon who are flying, levitating, or have the Naturewalk (Tundra) Capability are immune to this effect. When standing on a square affected by Frozen Domain, you may act as if you were in Hail weather. When a Fire-Type attack originates from or targets a square of Frozen Domain, that square of Frozen Domain melts and is cleared. Frozen Domain is considered a Hazard.",
