You create a Main or Off-Hand Equipment Item usable by Trainers that grants the user the chosen Capability. Whenever a Trainer makes Struggle Attacks using Zapper through this Item, they may choose to use your Technology Education Rank tripled in place of an offensive Stat. When this Feature is Unbound, the Equipment Item breaks and cannot be repaired. You may only have X instances of this Feature Bound at once, where X is equal to half your Technology Education Rank.",
