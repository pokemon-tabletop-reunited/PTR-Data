Expending a use of Messiah allows you to perform such a miracle. For example, in a region where Shaymin is known to restore withered forests to their former glory, a Touched who is a Messiah of Shaymin might be able to cause a forest to start to rapidly recover from the aftermath of a wildfire. Such acts are usually, but not always, noticeably supernatural and divine.",
