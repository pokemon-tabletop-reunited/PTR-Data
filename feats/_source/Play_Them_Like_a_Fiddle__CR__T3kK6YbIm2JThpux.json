You may use the effects of each Move only once per Scene.\n- Baby-Doll Eyes: The target becomes Infatuated with you for the rest of the Scene, and cannot be cured of this condition by any means, including Taking a Breather. This does not bypass immunity to Infatuation.\n- Confide: You choose a Move the target has used this Scene. That Move becomes Disabled for the target. Leer: The target’s Defense is lowered an additional Combat Stage, and their Special Defense is lowered by 2 Combat Stages.\n- Sweet Kiss: While the target is Confused, they may not perform Disengage Maneuvers, and whenever they hit themselves in Confusion, they provoke an Attack of Opportunity from all of their adjacent foes.\n- Taunt: For 1 full round, the next damaging attack to hit the target of Taunt deals +3d8+10 Damage.\n- Torment: The target’s Ability is disabled until the end of the encounter. If the target has more than one Ability, you choose one of them to disable.\n- Lovely Kiss: The target’s Evasion is lowered by 2 for the rest of the Scene.",
