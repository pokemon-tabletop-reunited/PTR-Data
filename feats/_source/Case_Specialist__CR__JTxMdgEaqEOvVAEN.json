This may only affect a target once per Scene.\n- Flash Case: The Case uses the Move Flash as a Burst 2 instead of a Cone 2.\n- Bounce Case: The Poké Ball bounces an additional time. This may not cause it to hit a target more than once.\n- Zap Case: The target can only use At-Will actions until the end of their next turn. This may only affect a target once per Scene.",
