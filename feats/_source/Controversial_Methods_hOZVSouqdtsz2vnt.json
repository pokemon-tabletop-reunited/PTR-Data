The target Pokémon gains Shadow Type and becomes a Shadow Pokémon, granting the target all of the traits and restrictions inherent to Shadow Pokémon. The target Pokémon's Friendship is reduced to 0 as a result of this process.\n\nAdditionally, you can replace up to 2 moves with a Shadow Type move from the Shadow Pokémon Move List. For those Moves that are replaced by Shadow Moves, the replacements can be moves from the official Shadow Movelist, or be versions of the Pokémon’s existing Moves made into Shadow Moves, adhering to the following restrictions:\n\n»» Damaging Moves can only be replaced by a Shadow Move whose DB is less than or equal to the replaced Move, and maintain the same damage class (Physical or Special).\n»» Status Moves can only be replaced by Status class Shadow Moves of the same frequency of the base move.",
