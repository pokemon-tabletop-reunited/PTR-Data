These Hazards cause foes that run into them to become Slowed until the end of their next turn and have an additional effect based on the terrain in which the item was made. When foes run into these Hazards, they are destroyed after their effects resolve. You may create and hold a number of these items equal to half your Survival Rank. If you create any more, one of the older items loses all effect.\n- Dust Trap – Grassland or Desert: A foe that runs into this Hazard is Blinded until the end of their next turn.\n- Tangle Trap – Forest or Wetlands: A foe that runs into this Hazard is must immediately stop Shifting, and they are Stuck instead of Slowed until the end of their next turn.\n- Slick Trap – Ocean or Tundra: A foe that runs into this Hazard becomes Vulnerable until the end of their next Turn.\n- Abrasion Trap – Mountain, Cave, or Urban: A foe that runs into this Hazard lowers their Defense and Special Defense by 1 Combat Stage.",
